# A collection of D&D 5e randomizers.

## **This runs in command-line using Node.js** 
This requires [node](https://nodejs.org) to already be installed\
Then navigate to the folder in cmd or whatever terminal your os uses and run the js using the format:\
node name.js *optional arguments after*

### **Programs:**
**npc.js**\
A script for randomizing characters from the D&D 5th edition official reference materials. They do not include descriptions for the features/spells it lists out, so you will need a copy of the 5e book as a reference. This merely speeds up character making, and is useful for a dm to make new npc out of thin air mid-session. These are canon for any table.

**npc-homebrew.js**\
A script for randomizing characters for fun other uses. My friend liked my npc.js and wanted to goof around with it without affecting the canon 5e content. This runs off the same logic as npc.js but uses fake goofy races, classes, ect. Likely will end up mostly being anime related.

**loot.js**\
A script for randomizing weapons/armor for use in D&D 5th edition. They also get random enchanted (and sometimes cursed) properties I cooked up and are for homebrew tables.

**getSpells.js**\
A script to be used in a web browser's dev console. Copy and paste it in there. This one is intended for dndbeyond.com's html on their spell search page. Its just a helper script (*and will probably be gone when I finish the project*) for producing a comma seperated list of spells when making the spell.json but you can use it if you ever need a quick way to type up a list of spells.
